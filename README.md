# Convolution Animation

This project visualizes the process of convolution, commonly used in image processing and neural networks, through an interactive animation built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Features
- Interactive convolution animation
- Adjustable parameters (kernel, stride, etc.)
- Visualizes how convolution works on an input image
- Built with p5.js for easy customization and extension

## Demo
Open `index.html` in your browser to view and interact with the animation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Interact with the animation and explore convolution!

## Dependencies
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (included in `libraries/`)

## Customization
- Replace `assets/input.png` with your own image to see how convolution works on different inputs.
- Modify `sketch.js` to experiment with different kernels or animation styles.
